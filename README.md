# Impossibrawler
A rev challenge made for 2023 CSAW CTF Qualifying round. 

This is a game developed in Godot 3.5 where the game contains some issues within it that prevent the player from being able to beat it and obtain the flag. It involves decompiling the game, accessing the files within Godot 3.5, and reverse engineering it to make the game playable/easier.
